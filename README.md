# Galapagos Research and Monitoring Database System (GaRMDS)
This is my 3rd milestone project with Code Institute and their Full Stack Web Developer course.

## Demo
![Demo](/static/images/demoGif/demo.gif)

## Summary 

My wife is a marine biologist who has worked with sea turtles in Galapagos. In their conservation work they collect data from hundreds of individuals with the purpose to monitor the sea turtle population. The field work is challenging, where the standard method is to note on paper and later, in the lab, enter the data into a spreadsheet which leads to data being lost or mixed up during entry. Because of this a simple input method is needed where data can be entered instantly and on site.

### Project purpose: 

The purpose of this project is to build a full-stack site that allows turtle conservationists to manage a common dataset about sea turtle populations in the Pacific.

Value provided:

The application allows users to monitor and sustainably manage marine turtle populations as well as their nesting and foraging sites. It provides invaluable information for Pacific countries and territories to manage their turtle resources as well as search the catalog and filter based on various parameters.

## UX

### User Stories:
* As a user I want to be able to search for individual turtles that already exist in the database.

* As a user I want to be able to contact the administrator of the site.

### User Stories:
* As a user I want to be able to add my own turtle data to the database.

* As a user I want be able to edit existing data on turtle individuals.

* As a user I want to be able to delete existing data on turtle individuals.

### Design and Colors

#### Colors

* ![#5A9DB4](https://placehold.it/15/FFFFFF/000000?text=+) #FFFFFF - Primary background color

* ![#5A9DB4](https://placehold.it/15/5A9DB4/000000?text=+) #5A9DB4 - Button hover color, Form input field label color, Datepicker hover color

#### Fonts

For all fonts I used Roboto, from Google Fonts. This font works well with the design as it is modern and simple. > Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. - [[Google Fonts, 2020]](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).


#### Wireframes

I wanted to have a table with pagination using Material Design for Bootstrap but it became very cumbersome since the css and scripts overlapped and confronted those of Materialize so in the end I decided to use the materialize parallax template where the background image is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling.

##### Final wireframes:

## Features

### Existing Features

* Header: Allows user to know the name of the project as well as understanding what it is.

* Carousel cards: Allows users a sneak peek of the catalogue. It also allows the user to quickly edit an individual by clicking on it.

* Features: Lets read the main features and practical value of the website

* Turtles page: Allows users to create read update and delete (CRUD) individuals from the database

* Footer: Allows the user to see copyright, date of project completion and author. 

### Features Left to Implement

This database may get extensive in the future, so it would be convenient to implement some filters that allow for basic and fast queries with the purpose of finding an individual quickly without the need to search the entire database.

## Technologies

### Languages
* [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)
    * A markup language that it is used for structuring and presenting content. 
* [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)

    * The project uses it to get elegant fonts without compromising usersâ€™ privacy or security.
* [Drawio](https://app.diagrams.net/)
    * A streamlined web app that was used to create diagrams. It was used to create the project mockups.
* [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)

## Testing

This site was tested with the inspection function of Chrome and Firefox and the featured mobile view that they provide (iphone 6, 7, 8 plus and ipad). No issues were detected during the testing. Neither were any issues found when tests were performed in devices with high contrast.

I used [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check the markup validity of Web documents in HTML and CSS. Highlighted errors:

### CSS Validation
Before:

| ------------|:----------------:| :----------------:| :----------:| :---------------:|
|User opens the project| Logo takes user to Home page | Home page is accessed | Pass | This works on every page of the project
|       | The carousel loads with individuals | The carousel shows the individuals in the database | Pass | Only 5 individuals will be visible at one time
|    | The carousel doesn't load individuals | The carousel doesn't show | Pass | This happens when the database is empty
|    | User clicks on "Get started" | User is directed to the turtle catalogue | Pass |
|    | "Home" takes user to Home page | Home page is accessed | Pass | This works on every page of the project 
|    | User clicks on "New Turtle" | User is directed to the turtle editor | Pass | This works on every page of the project 
|    | User clicks on "Manage Capture" | User is directed to the capture editor | Pass | This works on every page of the project

### Unit tests
For unit tests the [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/2.5/introduction) unit testing framework was used

* For the 1st test I Mock out Google Maps Places API following with Jasmine Spies created by [Kevin Wilson](https://kwilson.io/blog/mock-out-google-maps-geocoder-with-jasmine-spies/)
    [![Create Marker test](assets/images/tests/CreateMarker.png)](testsJasmineWithMap.html)


* For the second test try to verify that the map was created correctly and this mainly depends on whether or not the browser used supports geolocation, so just showing an alert that the browser supports geolocation would be sufficient.
  To do this I instantiated the constructor and called the function initMapa and `spyOn(window, 'alert');`

## Deployment

The project was created with IntelliJ and the site is hosted by GitHub. Different branches were used, each one with various commits, named depending on their long-term purpose and changed characteristic respectively. Several pull requests were created once the branch's purpose was fulfilled. It was used the master branch which allows every change, commit and push to show immediately in real time to users.

### Allowing GitHub to publish from your site

* Find the [repository](https://github.com/ArloysMacias/Near) on GitHub.

* Under the repository name click `Settings`

* Click `Save

* A green information should appear that says "Your site is published at [https://user-name.github.io/Project-Name/](https://arloysmacias.github.io/Near/)"

### Cloning your repository to create local copy

* Select the [Repository](https://github.com/ArloysMacias/Near)

* Click on the 'Clone or Download' button

* Copy the URL provided

* Open terminal (Mac) / Open Git Bash (Windows) 

* Find the directory you want to clone the repository to

* Type `git clone` and paste the URL, press Enter
