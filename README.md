## Summary 

My wife is a marine biologist who has worked with sea turtles in Galapagos. In their conservation work they collect data from hundreds of individuals with the purpose to monitor the sea turtle population. The field work is challenging, where the standard method is to note on paper and later, in the lab, enter the data into a spreadsheet which leads to data being lost or mixed up during entry. Because of this a simple input method is needed where data can be entered instantly and on site.

### Project purpose: 

The purpose of this project is to build a full-stack site that allows turtle conservationists to manage a common dataset about sea turtle populations in the Pacific.

Value provided:

The application allows users to monitor and sustainably manage marine turtle populations as well as their nesting and foraging sites. It provides invaluable information for Pacific countries and territories to manage their turtle resources as well as search the catalog and filter based on various parameters.

## UX

### User Stories:
* As a user I want to be able to search for individual turtles that already exist in the database.

* As a user I want to be able to contact the administrator of the site.

* As a user I want to be able to add my own turtle data to the database.

* As a user I want be able to edit existing data on turtle individuals.

* As a user I want to be able to delete existing data on turtle individuals.

### Design and Colors

#### Colors

* ![#5A9DB4](https://placehold.it/15/FFFFFF/000000?text=+) #FFFFFF - Primary background color

* ![#5A9DB4](https://placehold.it/15/5A9DB4/000000?text=+) #5A9DB4 - Button hover color, Form input field label color, Datepicker hover color

#### Fonts

For all fonts I used Roboto, from Google Fonts. This font works well with the design as it is modern and simple. > Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. - [[Google Fonts, 2020]](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).


#### Wireframes

I wanted to have a table with pagination using Material Design for Bootstrap but it became very cumbersome since the css and scripts overlapped and confronted those of Materialize so in the end I decided to use the materialize parallax template where the background image is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling.

##### Final wireframes:

## Features

### Existing Features

* Header: Allows user to know the name of the project as well as understanding what it is.

* Carousel cards: Allows users a sneak peek of the catalogue. It also allows the user to quickly edit an individual by clicking on it.

* Features: Lets read the main features and practical value of the website

* Turtles page: Allows users to create read update and delete (CRUD) individuals from the database

* Footer: Allows the user to see copyright, date of project completion and author. 

### Features Left to Implement

This database may get extensive in the future, so it would be convenient to implement some filters that allow for basic and fast queries with the purpose of finding an individual quickly without the need to search the entire database.

    * Used to bridge Flask and PyMongo and provides some convenience helpers.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc)
    * Used for tracking changes in the code during software development.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) 
    * A Git repository hosting service which provides a Web-based graphical interface and is also used to trigger deployments.
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/idea/)
    * An integrated development environment (IDE) written in Java. It it is used for developing and coding. 
    
### Tools Used
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
    * Is used to store the database in the cloud.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) 
    * The project uses it to get vector icons and social logos.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) 
    * The project uses it to get elegant fonts without compromising usersâ€™ privacy or security.
* [Drawio](https://app.diagrams.net/)
    * A streamlined web app that was used to create diagrams. It was used to create the project mockups.
* [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)
    * Used to find the right Favicon for the project.    
* [Canva photos](https://www.canva.com/photos/)
    * Used to find the background images.     
* [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

## Testing

This site was tested with the inspection function of Chrome and Firefox and the featured mobile view that they provide (iphone 6, 7, 8 plus and ipad). No issues were detected during the testing. Neither were any issues found when tests were performed in devices with high contrast.

I used [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check the markup validity of Web documents in HTML and CSS. Highlighted errors:

### Defensive design
For the moment, the project is created for a closed group of researchers working in the Galapagos. And for that reason, no admin credentials are needed to access and handle (create, edit, delete) the database.

## Deployment

The project was created with IntelliJ and the site is hosted by GitHub. Different branches were used, each one with various commits, named depending on their long-term purpose and changed characteristic respectively. Several pull requests were created once the branch's purpose was fulfilled. It was used the master branch which allows every change, commit and push to show immediately in real time to users.
